## Notes

This project felt much more straight forward, coding experience is increasing, catching the smaller errors that I wasnt able to see easily before. Had an issue at first with images not displaying, but ressolved with using a different attribute in the xml list. Also had issues, at first, with adding the timestamp to the recyclerview, issue was simple typos here and there and a missing statement in the adapter.
